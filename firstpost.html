        <h2>Prologue: Fatal encounter with Smeraldo</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm a florist Testesso.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I created this blog is because I wanted to tell you about 
            a flower like Smeraldo. At the moment I am preparing for the opening 
            of a store specializing in this flower by mid-September. Someone might 
            think that a blog is a way to promote a store, but I think that my 
            meeting with Smeraldo is not just a business. The thread of fate 
            that connects me with Smeraldo first manifests itself five years ago. 
            I studied abroad in North Dakota (Central North America) and decided.
            Travel to Virginia to participate in FLOWER 2012, which was organized 
            by the American Florist Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the plan, it took five hours to get from North Dakota 
            to Virginia, but it took me seven hours to get from my hostel to the 
            academy. But after this long journey, all that I found at the venue 
            was a banner that says “Origin playing cards. " "FLOWER 2012" ended 
            last week, and then the American Academy of Playing Cards held its 
            event here. I wrote the wrong date in my notebook. At that moment I 
            was excited and dumbfounded, but now, looking back, I think it was 
            fate. I was so tired that I still had no strength to go somewhere 
            else, so I just stayed there to listen to a lecture.
         </p>
         <p>
            Fortunately, the lecture turned out to be interesting and I was 
            especially fascinated by the part about the flower, because I work 
            as a florist. You guess that this flower was "Smeraldo"? If you look 
            at the photo, you will understand that Smeraldo has its own pleasant 
            atmosphere. Romantic petal shape with a soulful and mysterious color. 
            Don't you feel that a sad story is behind it? And it is true. 
            Smeraldo is a flower with a heartbreaking story. You can familiarize 
            yourself with this story using the language of flowers, in which “non 
            potevo dire la verità” means “truth that cannot be said” translated 
            from Italian. Thinking about this meaning, do you understand that this 
            is a story about love, tragic love? Right? From now on, I will little 
            by little tell in this blog a story about Smeraldo and playing cards.
