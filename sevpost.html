        <h2>The truth untold</h2>
        <p>
             In fact, my family is not very rich. It was difficult for me to 
             study abroad. I was a foreigner and did not speak English. I could 
             not imagine my future. That day, when we promised each other to fly 
             to Italy together, I was waiting for my friend at the airport. Then 
             I saw the glass door outside, as it gets out of the bus with a tough 
             guy. I hid right there. Why did I do this ... I don’t know either ... 
             I just instinctively hid, turned the other way and left. I thought: 
             “That's right. We cannot go to Italy together. For her, I'm just a 
             miserable foreigner who knows nothing. ”
        </p>
        <p>
             She called, but I didn’t pick up the phone. I just stupidly looked 
             at myself in the toilet mirror at the airport. We booked one flight, 
             so it was supposed to be somewhere on the plane, but I did not go to 
             her. I was just hoping. I hoped that she would look around the plane 
             and return to find me. But even after the plane crossed the Atlantic, 
             crossed the Italian sky and landed at the airport ... No one came to 
             find me. ‘La Città di smeraldo’ was a painful and happy memory for me. 
             Smeraldo's flower was so beautiful that I sobbed. And something 
             strange happened that night. I was sleeping at home when I heard a 
             strange noise. My bed was far from the window, but I could hear 
             someone knocking on it. It was a two-level room, and the outside 
             was quiet. 
        </p>
        <p>    
             It was already after midnight, the windows were curtained, so I 
             could not see anything. I was not afraid, it was just strange. I 
             wanted to get up and see who was still knocking on the window, but 
             stopped. I forced myself to think that these branches hit the window 
             and tried to fall asleep again, but, to be honest, I couldn’t. I 
             continued to listen to this sound and to lie to myself that I had 
             experienced this situation many times. It was about noon when that 
             friend called me. But no, it was not her, but her brother. My friend 
             went to the airport when she had an accident, and after midnight she 
             had breathing problems and went into another world. Before leaving 
             the hostel, I opened a window near my bed. The sun was shining and 
             the Smeraldo was growing somewhere far away. I looked at the flowers, 
             sat under the sun and felt a breath of wind.
        </p>
        <p>
             It was just for a moment, but I felt that she was looking at the 
             flowers with me. On the way home from the airport upon my return to 
             America, I received the good news that my dream would come true. My 
             flower shop with Smeraldo in Korea has been approved by the Smeraldo 
             Academy. Since this flower is a rare species, the Academy carefully 
             controls all foreign sales, but now my registration in the 
             association has been approved. After that ... Three years have 
             passed since I opened a store in Korea, but every time I return to 
             the thought of my friend, who left before I could see him.
