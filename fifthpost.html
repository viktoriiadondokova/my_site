        <h2>Ashblass's cards</h2>
        <p>
            In a previous post, I told you the story of Smeraldo. Do you still 
            remember the place where I met this flower, about the Academy of 
            Playing Cards? Are you interested in the connection between Smeraldo 
            and playing cards? Today I will talk about a figure closely associated 
            with maps - about William Ashbless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Very little is known about Ashbless, in addition to being an Italian 
            nobleman and poet. He was also well versed in maps that began to gain 
            popularity in 16th-century Europe. He made playing cards for the palace 
            and the noble salons, but they said Ashbless fell ill, immersed himself 
            in his work. This happened when he visited the village to unwind. In 
            search of hot springs and fresh air to restore health, Ashbless 
            stumbled upon the Smeraldo.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the edge of the village, where only the ruins of the castle 
            remained, a flower of unearthly beauty blossomed. None of the locals 
            knew his name, and later he heard about a love story from an old 
            woman from the village. As you understand, being absorbed in playing 
            cards, Ashbless was a romantic nature. The story of an ugly man and 
            a poor woman was an inspiration to him. Ashblesse gave the name to 
            the flower and gave its meaning in the language of flowers. The 
            flower was called "Smeraldo", taking the end of the name of the 
            village - ‘La Città di smeraldo’, and in the language of flowers it 
            meant ‘non potevo dire la verità’ (a truth that cannot be said). 
            Returning home, he drew a card with this flower and named it “Flower 
            Card”, and also included it in the set of “Ashbless Cards”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its direct meaning is “pleasure”, “flowering”, and inverted - “fall”, 
            “end” and “new start”. It was said that the Ashbless Maps became a 
            sensation in Europe. But few remember this now. The thing is that 
            during the inter-noble struggle, the Ashbless family lost their 
            status and left no trace in history. Together with them, the Ashbless 
            Cards and the story of the Smeraldo flower were forgotten. But, as 
            happens with any beautiful legend, there are things that do not allow 
            to forget about it. The love story and the Ashbless story will be back. 
            I will talk about this in the next post.
