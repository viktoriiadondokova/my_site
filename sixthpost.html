        <h2>Madame Lenormand and the Flower Card</h2>
        <p>
            This painting by the French artist Jean-Francois Rolland is called 
            Madame Lenormand in the Salon. Madame Lenormand was said to be an 
            astrologer, the highly regarded wife of Napoleon, Josephine. Before 
            becoming an astrologer, Josephine, she was known for reading tarot 
            for noble women and the patronage of fortune. Her ‘Lenormand Oracle 
            Card’ is known for influencing many cards from other decks. Even now, 
            the oracle card is sold on most tarot sites. Since Madame Lenormand 
            was a famous astrologer, there are many paintings where she holds or 
            reads cards.

            The mentioned picture is one of them. But here we need to focus on 
            another detail. The painting by French artist Jean-Francois Rolland, 
            “Madame Lenormand in the Salon” was a gentle touch to a peculiar 
            lyrical atmosphere, but it was lost in a fire in a collector's mansion. 
            The owner of the mansion was known for his craving for art, 
            demonstrating the life of high society in the Napoleonic era, so he 
            looked for paintings on the site of the fire and was engaged in their 
            restoration. Many paintings were restored, but only a part with maps 
            was saved from this one. This part of the picture was presented by me 
            in a previous post. The “flower card” in her hand is a card from the 
            Ashbless set, based on the Smeraldo flower. This is the only trace in 
            history left by the Smeraldo and William Ashbless.
