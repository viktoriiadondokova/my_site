        <h2>
            Meet the Smeraldo Flower
        </h2>
        <p>
            Many people believe that flowers are designed for specific, special 
            days. I thought the same way before I became a florist. But the 
            teacher who taught me in America said: “We don’t need flowers on 
            special days, it is flowers that make days like that.”
        <p>
            When I decided to bring Smeraldo to Korea, these words became my 
            strength. "Even if they do not know about it, I hope they will be 
            happy to receive the Smeraldo ..." With these thoughts, I decided 
            to open a special Smeraldo Flowers store in September this year. 
            The interior of Smeraldo Flowers will be in a minimalist style, in 
            which white prevails to emphasize the beauty of the Smeraldo. 
        <p>    
            Fresh bouquets will be placed on the window differently, depending 
            on the atmosphere of each day, in order to become a fleeting piece 
            of happiness for a passerby. (Am I right? ..) The store is still 
            preparing for opening, but, if necessary, I offer delivery to some 
            areas. But please understand that then they will be in limited 
            quantities. Smeraldo can reflect a different atmosphere, so it is 
            important that you tell me in advance what you want. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Immediate flower delivery is not possible, on average, it takes one 
            week, and if delivery and search are necessary, you should leave the 
            order two weeks before receipt. (Of course, I will try to find 
            everything I need by the deadline.) Every day the weather becomes 
            incredibly stuffy. Since Smeraldo is grown on farms in northern 
            Italy, the abrupt climate change that can occur when transported to 
            Korea will harm the flower. Therefore, delivery will be carried out 
            only within a certain zone, so as not to spoil the appearance. In 
            this way, the Smeraldo can remain fresh and beautiful.
