        <h2>Legend about Smeraldo flower</h2>
        <p>
            Do you think you are beautiful? I once saw an experiment where 
            people had to choose between the doors with the words "I am beautiful" 
            and "I am ugly." If you participated in it, which one would you choose? 
            The reason I remembered this was the story of Smeraldo, of love. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The history of Smeraldo began in a village in northern Italy somewhere 
            in the 15-16 centuries. In a village called ‘La Città di smeraldo’ 
            there was a small secluded castle. An ugly man lived in this castle. 
            Little is known about this man. “He was the duke’s favorite child from 
            a powerful family in the Pyrenees. The duke fell in love with the 
            gardener's daughter and they had a baby, but her mother died of 
            bleeding during childbirth. The duke’s wife and children wanted to 
            get rid of the child, so he helped him escape. ” There were many 
            rumors, but not one was confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The man hid in the castle, alone. Perhaps due to the fact that from 
            childhood he was faced with hatred and insults, he could not open his 
            heart to anyone. And now he was angry and hiding when someone tried 
            to approach him. His only delight was growing the garden. But once, 
            a woman appeared near the castle. A woman in rags took off her shoes, 
            jumped over the fence and stole a flower. The man was very angry and 
            at first guarded the garden at night. But, catching a moment of slumber, 
            the woman again sneaked into the garden and stole a flower. This went 
            on for several days, until the man pretended to be asleep and tracked 
            how the woman appeared. He was interested. Unconsciously, a man was 
            waiting for her and once followed her.
        </p>
        <p>
            He covered himself with a cloak, followed her and found that that 
            poor and weak woman was selling flowers in order to survive. The man 
            wanted to help the woman. He wanted to teach her every way to grow 
            flowers that he knew. He wanted to teach her beautiful flowers to grow. 
            But he could not approach the woman. She might have been afraid of him; 
            she would not have liked his ugliness. In the end, all he could do was 
            grow flowers so she kept going to his garden. Man decided to create a 
            flower not from this world. He began to create a flower that a woman 
            could sell at a higher price. A man locked himself in a lock to make 
            a flower. After many countless attempts, he managed to create a flower 
            that never existed in this world and fill it with a garden. But the 
            woman did not appear again. No matter how long he waited, she did not 
            come into the garden. The man became worried and went to the village, 
            covering his face. But the woman was already dead. It was a Smeraldo 
            story. No one knows if she is true, but every time I see a Smeraldo, 
            she comes to my mind and makes me think. What if a man gathered all 
            his courage and showed his face, revealing the truth? A woman could 
            get scared and run away or get angry. Courage is a difficult thing.
