        <h2>I received the first Smeraldo order in Korea</h2>
        <p>
            Since, according to the plan, the Smeraldo Flowers store is due to 
            open in mid-September, I was busy planning customs shipments and ways 
            to deliver / store flowers. That is why I have not updated the blog 
            for a long time. Therefore, when I went to check, it was just in time 
            for the event [the florist held a contest among the readers of the 
            blog], I saw that many were interested in Smeraldo. A lot of people 
            participated in the competition. Thank you very much.
        </p>
        <p>
            In truth, today is my lucky day. I received the first order !! I was 
            at the place where the store was being built around noon and some 
            young man looked inside. It will sound strange, but my heart trembled. 
            It was like meeting a person whom I had known for a long time but 
            forgot. Honestly, I didn’t need to go to the store today, but in the 
            morning I somehow wanted to drop in there, perhaps in order to meet 
            this person there. I was also afraid, I don’t know, it was so strange. 
            What was even more surprising was that the person who came in was 
            looking for the Smeraldo! He said that he did not know that this was 
            a specialty store, he just came, as if something attracted him. This 
            is fate, isn’t it? In the end, we agreed on the delivery. I received 
            my first order in Korea!
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, because of the heat these days, delivering a Smeraldo is 
            not easy. Therefore, I told him that I could not deliver it until 
            the end of August, to which he assured that it was a great time, 
            and I accepted the order without any problems. But, looking at the 
            facial expression of the client while he spoke, I understood him. 
            It was a gift for someone important. So I said: “I want to attach a 
            card to the Smeraldo. What inscription on it would you like? ” For 
            some time he hesitated and wrote several options. What he wrote? I 
            will not speak, because it is personal. I asked him again: “But why 
            Smeraldo?”
        </p>
        <p>
            And he replied: "Because I want to be a good person." This means 
            that he wants to be good for the one to whom the flowers are intended, 
            right? After his departure, I thought a lot about the past. What 
            would happen if I were as sincere as this client? But, as you know, 
            to assume "what if" is completely pointless. As an idiot, I lost it, 
            but I hope that the client will be able to express their feelings and 
            will be happy. My event is also aimed at conveying sincere feelings 
            to people who should receive them. Today at 10 pm work will end, 
            please look forward to the results. I got a lot of stories, so I 
            need time, please understand this.
