        <h1>Legend of the Smeraldo flower</h1>
        <p>
            Smeraldo stands for ‘emerald’ in italian. Some say smeraldo 
            is a fictional flower which only appears in legend and fiction . 
            First of all, Smeraldo is not existing in present as it is said to 
            have failed to make ends meet. It could also be a reference to 
            ‘the emerald city of oz’, a sequel to the wizard of oz by American 
            Author L.Frank Baum. However, we do not know for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s said smeraldo(flower) stands for the ‘sincerity that could not 
            be delivered’.
            According to sources , the flower is known to have bloomed in 
            “La Citta Di Smeraldo”. A flourishing city which , supposedly, was 
            located in Northern Italy, during medieval times, but was abandoned 
            after the black death.
            According to a map which has surfaced in recent times, 
            “La Citta Di Smeraldo” is estimated to have being located in 
            northern Italy which is now a rural village.

            The smeraldo flower is quite symbolical.
        </p>
        <p>
            It represents an entangled love story surrounding the smeraldo which 
            is estimated to have taken pace around the 15th-16th centuries in 
            the city of “La Citta di smeraldo”. According to various sources, 
            the story supposedly has a tragic ending filled with yearning, 
            sadness and a sincerity that could not be delivered. According to 
            the story, there once lived a a man. He lived in a secluded castle 
            in La Citta di smeraldo.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is not much information about the man except that he was the 
            ‘love child’ of the duke of Florence who fell in love with a poor 
            gardener’s daughter. She passed away at child birth due to excessive 
            bleeding leaving the man alone in the world. Being a child born out 
            of wed-lock, he was the source of misery to the wife and children of 
            the duke , who tried to kill the poor boy. As a result, the duke sent 
            him to a place further away. There were many rumors, but none was revealed.
            It is said the man alone hid himself in solitude at the old castle 
            and wore a mask because he was very ‘ugly’.</p> 
        
            <p> Probably because of all 
            the hatred and jealousy he received as he lived, he didn’t open his 
            heart to anyone. When anyone tried to approach him, he would hid 
            himself away in anger and distrust. He shut himself from the world. 
            Both his body and his heart. His only joy was to grow flowers in his 
            garden. It made him happy and peaceful. But things took a beautiful 
            turn. A turn which would be a moment of beauty within the memories 
            at the corner of his head. A turn which would leave a sorrowful 
            scar his heart forever and bring in tears to his eyes. Fate was
            playing on him. One day, a girl appeared in front of him near the 
            vicinity of his castle. She was in ragged clothes.As he watched, 
            the girl picked up the heels of the garden fence, climbed over it 
            and stole some flowers. </p>
            <p>
            The man was mad as a hornet at first. 
            He was mad at her for stealing his precious flowers.He spent his 
            whole night guarding the flowers.But in his brief moment of sleep, 
            the girl picked up some flowers and ran away. Several nights continued 
            to pass like that, until the man pretended to be asleep and watched 
            the girl go.He was curious. Who was she? Why does she steal my 
            blooming pretty flowers every night? Without realizing it, the man 
            waited for the girl , and followed her one night.He disguised himself 
            with a cloak and followed her. After following her to a village, 
            he realized why she stole flowers at his garden every night. He found 
            out that the girl sells these flowers because she is very poor 
            and has no other way to provide a living for herself. He felt very 
            bad for her.Guilt filled him up. The man wanted to help the girl.
            He wanted to teach her every method of growing flowers he knew. 
            He wanted to teach her how to grow beautiful flowers.He was slowly  
            falling in love with her. The man started growing many flowers for 
            her and made sure they were of the best quality. He wanted to show 
            up infront of her. Tell her of his feelings towards her.But , 
            he knew he could not show up in front of her. She would be scared of him.
            He must hide. Because he was ugly.She would not love his ugly appearance.
            So he never got the courage to confront her. </p>
            <p>
            At the end, the only thing he could do was to grow and take care 
            of the flowers so that she would keep coming to his garden. With time, 
            he decided to himself that he would grow the most expensive flower
            (the Smeraldo)for her to sell. That was the only way he would unveil
            his sincerity to her.He locked himself in the castle. After many 
            attempts, he succeeded in making the flower.The flower was very 
            beautiful. It was something that never existed in the world.
            Afterwards, he filled his garden with the flower and waited till 
            nightfall for the girl to return. He waited and waited for the girl 
            to come back to the garden to steal the flower. But the girl did 
            not return. She was nowhere to be seen.No matter how much he waited, 
            the girl wouldn’t return to his garden. It made him anxious.He later 
            visited the village he followed her to. Unfortunately he found out 
            that the girl had died. He was afraid. Afraid that she will leave 
            him in the end.So he decided to wear a mask and go to see her.
            If the man had the courage, would he have shown his face and 
            expressed his sincerity? of course, the woman might have been scared 
            and run away, even gotten mad.But to have bravery is easier said 
            than done.
